        <h1>Welcome to MY MIND!!!!</h1>

        <!-- First blog post ever through html -->
        <p>Today we're just gonna talk about some random stuff 
            and you're gonna have to <em>deal with it</em> buddy. This morning I drank a cup of joe and started studying
            stuff to be a <strong>web developer</strong> because I'm broke and wanna make a bunch of money but am now too lazy
            and unmotivated to do manual labor. I must use my brain because I am no longer a scoundrel and am
            carrying the age of preexisting minor injuries that could become major if I decide to keep working
            jobs that I <strong>hate</strong> for people that I strongly dislike just to get <em>
            a crumb of the pie.</em></p>
        <!-- heat check -->
        <h3> This is what's on the agenda for goals:</h3>
        <p> The goal is to become a <strong>professional software developer</strong>. I will achieve this 
            goal by putting in as many hours as possible to study and practice coding every single day through 
            <em>The <strong>Odin</strong> Project.</em>The Odin Project is an open-source, free resource 
            for teaching people to be web developers focused on Javascript or Ruby (on Rails?). I am very 
            excited to be on this journey as it is self-paced and is a tried and true program 
            as well as <em><strong>Freeeeee.</strong></em>
        </p>

        <h6>Let those <em>wings</em> Flap and be <strong>FREE!!!!</strong></h6>
